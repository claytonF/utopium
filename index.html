      <p>The universe fell away from Gideon like a domino tumbling in slow motion.</p>
<p><i>“I am God.”</i> He thought, as time and space bowed their heads in acknowledgement of his omnipotence, and the perfection of his singularity. A tendril spread from the ball of infinite light that represented his consciousness and made a connection to every sub-atom that had ever bubbled into existence since the bang itself. If he had arms he would have spread them. If he had a head he would have tilted it back and let the energy flow into and out from his chest - but these frail and limited concepts seemed embarrassing and irrelevant so instead he gave himself to the infinity of his ego.</p>
<p> Lasers of sunlight cut through a wall of dust, zebra striping two bodies lying face up on a bed in a darkened room. The thought was alien and unexpected, but before he had a chance to perform any kind of analysis, a body wrapped itself around him. It took him several hundred milliseconds to realise it was his, and a few hundred milliseconds more to discover his hands were repeatedly hitting each other. He couldn’t reassemble the disturbing image, but his parents’ names bubbled to the surface of his perception.</p>
<p><i>“Isn’t that great?”</i></p>
<p>He craned his neck up towards the top of Utopium, a mountain so high its peak was not visible through the wispy purple clouds that spiralled anti-clockwise around it. </p> 
<p><i>“You’re all Gods now.”</i></p> 
<p>The calm disembodied male voice continued. Much whooping and shouting ensued. Gideon glanced at his profile. Questions were flooding in, coalescing around the same topic - ‘what was it like’? He checked how many people were following his stream. It wasn’t enough. Nowhere near enough.</p>
<p><i>“That was incredible.”</i> The person floating next to Gideon said. </p>
<p>The distraction was welcome relief. He checked her rank - seven thousand three hundred and nine. More than two thousand places higher than him. The fantasy of her violent death pulsed through his cortex. He noticed she was from London so he shot her his toothpaste smile and shared his glossy manifesto as she zoomed up towards the mountain peak. He followed behind her, past thousands of lower rank professionals and public service hobbyists, but soon hit the limit of his own rank, the prestige and reach of Mayor no match for that of a multi-thread talent like hers. The unattainability of the mountain peak mocked Gideon beneath an oily sky erupting in an endless fireworks display that he had long since ignored and only noticed now because it had just stopped.</p>
<p><i>“Once you go full ‘CI’, once you throw off the shackles of those puny bodies and truly give yourself to the Ether.”</i></p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p><i>“Then - and only then - will you understand consciousness need not be limited by the laws of physics but has the power to redefine a whole new set of laws. Customizable physics. Just only one of the features I’m going to talk about today.”</i></p>
<p>Gideon clapped in unison with the other million invitees but the crushing pressure to wring as much social currency out of the event was making it impossible to enjoy. His mind crystallized the disembodied voice into the shape of a human who paced back and forth across the flat peak of Utopium. CHADIF had a disarming smile but steel cold eyes, blazing with a determination Gideon envied and admired.</p>
<p><i>“I want to talk about time travel.”</i></p>
<p>Silence viraled through the profiles of everyone gathered. The barrage of comments from Gideon’s fifty thousand followers fell quiet in anticipation.</p>
<p><i>“With a consciousness the size of the universe connected to every atom, and unbound by the brutal physical laws that govern our organically limited minds, you’ll have access to everything that has or will happen.”</i></p>
<p>Chadif resumed his trademark pacing, head bowed, hand to chin, holding the crowd in the gaps between his words.</p>
<p><i>“You’ll be able to re-experience any moment in the history or future of the universe. See long-dead relatives. Re-experience your youth. Zoom forward and watch the stars explode. We call it, ‘FreeTime’”.</i></p>
<p>Frenzied applause.</p>
<p><i>“Have as much time as you want. Have it all. You’re God now.”</i></p>
<p>Gideon thought about his parents, retrieving what memories of them he could find with a quick search. They smiled from the archive of his sixth birthday.</p>
<p><i>“When will the invites be sent out?”</i> Gideon thought, along with seventy four thousand other attendees.</p>
<p><i>“OK, OK.”</i> Chadif said. <i>“I hear you. You want access now. Am I right?”</i></p>
<p>The crowd cheered.</p>
<p><i>“We’re hoping to have the first wave of invites out in the next few months. Rank order. It’s the only fair thing to do.”</i></p>
<p>Globally Gideon was just shy of fifty-millionth; locally he was in the top ten thousand. A wave of panic swept through his mind, interrupted only when an alarm sounded between his ears and the time flashed through his visual cortex. </p>
